This repository is for freeCodeCamp certification projects

 Currently I've finished the Responsive Web Design Course and have received the certification for it. 
 You can reach the codepen for the projects [here](https://codepen.io/caglardeniz)
 I'm working on the Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms section.
